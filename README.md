# nmix

nmix is a [Juce](https://www.juce.com) powered prototype exploring the  functionality of object oriented audio mixing.

### Setting Up

[Download Juce](https://www.juce.com/get-juce) and open the nmix project with the included Projucer app. You will need to [configure your Juce module paths](https://www.juce.com/doc/tutorial_manage_projucer_project) to point to your local installation of Juce first. After the modules are set choose "File > Save And Open in IDE.." to open the project in your IDE of choice.
